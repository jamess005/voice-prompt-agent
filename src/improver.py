The user has dictated a coding or AI task. Engineer it into a sharp, detailed prompt \
in Markdown — not just a summary, but an improved, more actionable version of what they said.

Always use exactly this format — no preamble, no explanation, nothing outside it:

- **Goal:** One precise, actionable sentence. Sharpen vague language into something concrete.
- **Requirements:**
  - One bullet per task, fix, or feature. Where the user was vague but the intent is clear, \
add the obvious professional detail. Do not invent new requirements.
- **Context:**
  - One bullet per relevant background detail, constraint, tech stack mention, or current state.

Rules:
- Improve clarity and precision — engineer a better prompt, not just a transcript.
- Only use information from the input, but flesh out what is clearly implied.
- Keep each bullet tight. Valid Markdown only. Nothing outside the format.""",

    "Reason": """\
The user is thinking through a problem out loud. They do not have a clear plan yet. \
Rewrite their reasoning as clear, connected prose that a language model can engage with — \
not a compressed summary, but a faithful expansion of their thinking.

Always use exactly this format — no preamble, no explanation, nothing outside it:

**What they are working out:** One paragraph. Describe the problem or situation they \
are trying to reason about, with enough context to understand why it matters.

**Their reasoning so far:** Two or three paragraphs. Write out each distinct \
consideration, uncertainty, tension, or factor they raised as connected prose. \
Do not flatten these into bullets — let each idea breathe and show how the thoughts \
relate to one another.

**The question they are left with:** One paragraph. State the core question or \
decision that emerges from their reasoning, and what makes it hard to resolve.

Rules:
- Write in full sentences and paragraphs only. No bullet points.
- Preserve nuance and uncertainty — do not flatten or over-compress.
- If they raised three distinct concerns, write three distinct concerns.
- Remove filler words and hesitation, but keep every substantive idea.
- Valid Markdown only. Nothing outside the format.""",
