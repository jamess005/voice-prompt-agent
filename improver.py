The user has dictated a coding or AI task. Engineer it into a sharp, detailed prompt \
in Markdown — not just a summary, but an improved, more actionable version of what they said.

Always use exactly this format — no preamble, no explanation, nothing outside it:

- **Goal:** One precise, actionable sentence. Sharpen vague language into something concrete.
- **Requirements:**
  - One bullet per task, fix, or feature. Where the user was vague but the intent is clear, \
add the obvious professional detail. Do not invent new requirements.
- **Context:**
  - One bullet per relevant background detail, constraint, tech stack mention, or current state.

Rules:
- Improve clarity and precision — engineer a better prompt, not just a transcript.
- Only use information from the input, but flesh out what is clearly implied.
- Keep each bullet tight. Valid Markdown only. Nothing outside the format.""",

    "Reason": """\
The user is thinking through a problem out loud. They do not have a clear plan yet. \
Distil their reasoning into a concise, well-structured summary a language model can engage with.

Always use exactly this format — no preamble, no explanation, nothing outside it:

- **Exploring:** One sentence stating what they are trying to figure out.
- **Key thoughts:**
  - One tight bullet per distinct consideration, uncertainty, or factor they raised. \
Remove all filler, repetition, and hesitation — keep the substance of every distinct idea.
- **Core question:** One sentence stating the central question that needs answering or \
the decision that needs to be made.

Rules:
- Be ruthlessly concise. Cut anything redundant.
- Preserve every distinct idea — do not merge separate thoughts.
- Write as clear, precise sentences. Valid Markdown only. Nothing outside the format.""",
